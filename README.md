# mymoviesite
Interview test for OmniAppSolutions.

## Summary  
I realize a few of my approaches in terms of the database models are not standard, but it's all I could figure out with the time I had this week. Completing this interview test was my first attempt at using the Django framework. Regardless, I believe I satisfied the basic requirements. 

## To Run
When running, application main page is at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/cinemalistings/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/cinemalistings/)

## Data Import  
I used the admin dashboard to import the data from `movies.json` into each respective Model.
